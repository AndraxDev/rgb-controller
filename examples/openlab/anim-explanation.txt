s # s Means stack end. Add it to the end of animation part (if no pause is present), otherwise last frame will not be rendered.
# All commands before the pause are stacked into a single matrix frame and sent as a single MQTT packet.
# This approach is used to optimize amount of MQTT packets sent to the server making animation smoother.
